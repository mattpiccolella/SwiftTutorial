# Swift Tutorial

This represents my learning of Apple's Swift language. Included within this repository are various Swift files that introduce many of the basic concepts of the new language. The code is heavily commented, as this is meant to be a reference for myself to various aspects of the language and how they differ from languages I am more familiar with.

Much of the code is taken from Apple's "The Swift Programming Language" book. Each Swift file rougly corresponds to a file taken from this book. 

I hope you find it helpful in learning the new language.
